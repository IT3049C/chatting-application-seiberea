## Self-Reflection:
<!-- Write your self-reflection under this line -->
This assignment was no easy task, and that was okay for me. A difficult assignment is a great one,
as it pushes me to learn and understand the concepts more. I ran into many errors doing this assignment, but it
helped me learn more and understand the concepts this assignment was offering.

### How long it took me to finish this?

3-ish or so hours, counting all the errors and restarts I had to do.


## Discussion Questions:
1. What does the bootstrap `display-4` class do?

Helps in controling the display of elements.
